    <h1>JavaScript Program To Find The Area Of A Triangle where Lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.</h1>
    <p>To find the area of triangle with the 3 sides, we have to use the Heron's Formula :- <br/>Area =âˆš [s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)], where a, b, c = 5, 6, 7. and s = (a+b+c)/2</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        const a = 5;
        const b = 6;
        const c = 7;
        let s = (a+b+c)/2;
        let area = Math.sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c));
        let element = document.getElementById("demo");
        element.innerHTML = "Area of a triangle with 3 sides is : " + area;
